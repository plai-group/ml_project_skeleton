Deep learning project skeleton. I use my forked versions of skeletor-ml and track-ml to manage experiments, but rewrite main.py with whatever experiment tracker you prefer ([sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred) is supposed to be good.) Data and experiment-wide parameter can be stored in `global_objs.py` to avoid having to pass them around from function to function.
